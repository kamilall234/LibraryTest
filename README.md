# LibraryTest
Test

Simple application for test task.

Application works in command line. Please follow the commends. 

In application is not included Exception throwing. I focused on implementation each of method from the Task.

Author class is not used finally, because of no time. Author is String field in Book class.

Please compile the Application.java
LibraryService is maintain all apllication.

No unit Tests, but was in plan to test Book.class and Library.class.

All of the details I tried described in comments. Simple methods are not described, the name of the method is telling what method is doing.
